Title: About me
I am currently a Phd student at the institute for theoretical physics in Hannover working on topological quantum systems.
Those systems are particularly interesting since they might solve one of the biggest problems that prevents us from building quantum computer, namely decoherence.
 Besides my research in theoretical physics I am constantly developing my data science skills and will post some of my projects here along the way.
